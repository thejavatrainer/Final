Use the api.exchangeratesapi.io (https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?symbols=RON ) to retrieve the rate of exchange between EUR and RON, and trigger alerts when the rate changes, by interrogating the API each minute for the latest rates.

You should separate the concerns of your application classes by having each class handle one responsibility. Example:

CurrencyRatesAlertingEngine – triggering the api searches and detects when notifications need to be sent.
CurrencyRatesService – (or query service) – a service that performs the actual API call and parses the result into something meaningful.
CurrencyChangeListener – a class where you can customize what to do when the rates changes.

Hint: For HTTP call you can use spring-web library, RestTemplate() class.

Make unit tests for all classes. Mock the dependencies (eg, CurrencyRateService and CurrencyChangeListener for the Engine).
